### Target

<p>

*  Complete index(home) page layout, including RWD.

</p>

### Ready to write code

<p>

*  You need to finish index(home) page layout by HTML and CSS in this part, we usually set URL as index.html, beside the home page, we also call it as landing page, the target of landing page is to attract attention from viewer/user.
*  There are logo and icon ready: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KA1laH0ZA3LVWWLWWRG2b6nf14ZBznYW
*  Layout design from UI/UX ready: https://frankyeah.github.io/Front-Enter/index.html
*  About mobile version, you should shrink the website into 320-479px width and then finish it; about Ipad version, you can follow your idea to design it.
*  Do not mimic my way to design CSS, complete it by yourself.


</p>

### Desk & Mobile

<p>

*  Try to let your layout adapt every **vehicle**. 
*  After complete static layout, try to design some effect on it.

</p>

### Reminder

<p>

*  Ugly code is acceptable at the first time, just remember to impove it everytime. 
*  Do not use any **module** or **package** in the whole class, e.g. jQuery、bootStrap. only HTML、CSS、JavaScript is acceptable.
*  When you design effect, you can use transition or animation on your own, do not use **package** as well.
