### Ready to write code

<p>

*  You need to finish home page in this part, we usually set URL as index.html , beside the home page, we also call it as landing page, the target of landing page is to attract attention from viewer. designer and engineer must treat it seriously.
*  There are logo and icon ready: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KA1laH0ZA3LVWWLWWRG2b6nf14ZBznYW
*  Layout design from UI/UX ready: https://frankyeah.github.io/Front-Enter/index.html
*  About mobile version, you should shrink the website into 320-479px width and then finish it; about ipad version, you can follow your idea to design it.
*  Do not mimic my way to design CSS, complete it by yourself is important.


</p>

### Desk & Mobile

<p>

*  Try to let your layout adapt every **vehicle**. 
*  After complete static layout, try to design some effect on it.

</p>

### Reminder

<p>

*  Ugly code is acceptable at the first time, just remember to impove everytime. 
*  Do not use any **module** or **package** in the whole class, e.g. jQuery、bootStrap. only HTML、CSS、JavaScript is acceptable.
*  When you are design effect, you can use transition or animation on your own, do not use **package** as well.
