### Local storage

<p>

1.  In this part, we will use **local storage** to collect data.
2.  First, let's go back to article page, and create a icon on every article, after clicking on it, it will display solid / hollow shape to express chosen or not.
3.  When user click on collect button, you have to write data（uid or other） into the **local storage**, it's a convenience way to bring data to another page.
4.  Last, show personal collection on the member page, and make it enable to delete and link to the specific page.
